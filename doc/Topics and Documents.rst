Topics and Documents
=====================

So far, there are two topics included in this repository:

- image processing
- data visualization

|

Image Processing
----------------
The document "picture_format.ipynb" illustrates the following procedures:

- how to generate images with numpy arrays
- how to save them in .png format
- how to load and convert them to Python lists
- how to save them in .csv files
- how to read them as pandas dataframes


Here an example of images generated in this document (digits in this case):

.. image:: digits.png

Here an example of the data content of these images in table format
(px stands for pixel):

.. image:: data_table.png

The code documentation in this document is in German.

Data Visualization
------------------
The document "basic_data_visualization.ipynb" illustrates the following procedures:  

- how to generate data using mathematical functions
- how to plot this data using matplotlib
- how to change default plotting options
- how to visualize data with several attributes using seaborn

Here an example of plotted mathematical functions: 

.. image:: function_plot.png  

Here an example of plotted data with several attributes (the Iris dataset in this case):

.. image:: iris_plot.png

The code documentation in this document is in English.
