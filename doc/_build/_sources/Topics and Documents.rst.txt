Topics and Documents
=====================

So far, there are two topics included in this repository:

- image processing
- data visualization

|

Image Processing
----------------
The document "picture_format.ipynb" illustrates the following procedures:

- how to generate images with numpy arrays
- how to save them in .png format
- how to load and convert them to Python lists
- how to save them in .csv files
- how to read them as pandas dataframes


Here an example of some generated images (digits in this case):

.. image:: digits.png

Here an example of the data content of these images in table format
(px stands for pixel):

.. image:: data_table.png

The code documentation in this notebook is in German.
